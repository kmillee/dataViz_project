# dataViz_project
Visualization of a survey reagarding discriminations, conducted in every EU country.

Project group: Camille Jouanet & Mai-Lan Pho <br>
Database : "Special Eurobarometer SP535 : Discrimination in the European Union" <br>
URL : https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/s2972_99_2_sp535_eng?

We will work on a collection of datasets representing opinions of a panel of UE citizens on different aspects of discrimination. 
These datasets gather different classifications of the answers, meaning they can be sorted by countries, by gender or age of the respondents for example.

The idea is to be able to represent these data in a modulable interface, where the user would visualize data on multiple formats, 
depending on the criteria they choose. By combining the different volumes of data we have, we could produce more specific datasets 
regarding the subject of discrimination (among race, religion and gender), as well as the panel from which the data were collected.
